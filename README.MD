<h3 align="center">About</h3>

Bedrock Inventory Animations is a client side mod that animates item movement inside of inventories.

- It is avaible for Fabric and NeoForge since Minecraft version 1.21 (1.19.4 from the initial mod)

- If you use the Fabric version you need the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and you will need [Modmenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to able to access the settings menu.
